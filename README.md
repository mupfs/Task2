Spring Framework Application – Task 2 (REST API)

This repository contains a Spring Boot REST API application developed as Task 2 for the Spring Framework Apps – Projects for Everyone course at Akademia Finansów i Biznesu Vistula.

The project demonstrates a complete backend REST application built using Spring Boot, following clean layered architecture, REST principles, proper exception handling, API documentation with Swagger, and database persistence using Spring Data JPA and H2.

📌 Task 2 – REST API with Spring Boot
🎯 Objective

The objective of Task 2 is to design and implement a RESTful backend application that:

Exposes REST endpoints using standard HTTP methods

Applies layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

Uses DTOs and object mapping

Implements centralized exception handling

Documents APIs using Swagger / OpenAPI

Persists data using Spring Data JPA and an H2 in-memory database

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Spring Boot

Spring Web

Spring Data JPA

H2 Database

Swagger / OpenAPI

Maven

Postman

Hibernate

🏗️ Application Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

Controller → Service → Repository → Database

Application Flow

Client sends an HTTP request in JSON format

Controller receives the request and maps it to a DTO

Service layer processes business logic

Repository interacts with the database

Mapper converts Entities ↔ DTOs

Controller returns an HTTP response with appropriate status

📡 REST API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	HTTP Status
POST	/api/v1/products	Create a new product	201 Created
GET	/api/v1/products/{id}	Get product by ID	200 OK
GET	/api/v1/products	Get all products	200 OK
PUT	/api/v1/products/{id}	Update product	200 OK
DELETE	/api/v1/products/{id}	Delete product	204 No Content
🧾 Example JSON Requests
Create Product (POST)
{
  "name": "Laptop"
}

Update Product (PUT)
{
  "name": "MacBook"
}

❗ Exception Handling

Custom exception: ProductNotFoundException

Centralized exception handling using @ControllerAdvice

Proper HTTP status codes returned (e.g. 404 NOT FOUND)

Error responses wrapped in a structured ErrorMessageResponse

📘 API Documentation (Swagger / OpenAPI)

Swagger UI is enabled for interactive API documentation and testing.

Swagger UI:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

OpenAPI JSON:
http://localhost:8080/v1/api-docs

🗄️ Database Integration (H2 + JPA)

In-memory H2 database

Hibernate automatically generates database tables

Entity mapping using:

@Entity

@Id

@GeneratedValue

Repository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long>

H2 Console

URL: http://localhost:8080/console

JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

🧪 Testing

The REST endpoints were tested using:

Swagger UI

Postman

Browser (GET requests)

Test Coverage

Full CRUD operations

Valid and invalid input cases

Exception handling for non-existing product IDs

❓ Lecturer’s Question (Slide 63)
Why does JpaRepository work without method implementations?

The repository interface is defined as:

public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {
}


Despite having no explicit method implementations, methods such as:

save()

findById()

findAll()

deleteById()

work automatically.

Explanation

This behavior is provided by Spring Data JPA:

JpaRepository is part of Spring Data JPA

At runtime, Spring uses dynamic proxy generation and reflection

Spring scans repository interfaces and generates concrete implementations

Hibernate (as the JPA provider) translates method calls into SQL queries

This follows the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle

As a result:

Developers define what they need (interfaces)

Spring decides how it is implemented

No manual repository implementation is required

This mechanism keeps the codebase clean, readable, and easy to maintain.

✅ Learning Outcomes (Task 2)

Building REST APIs with Spring Boot

Applying clean architecture principles

Using DTOs and object mapping

Handling exceptions properly

Documenting APIs with Swagger

Persisting data using Spring Data JPA and H2

📌 Final Notes

The project is version-controlled using Git

.gitignore is included to exclude unnecessary files

The application is ready for live demonstration and testing

The solution follows Spring Boot and REST best practices
